Hi, I'm a Fullstack developer.

## Current Projects and Activities

### [Angular YouTube Player and Asynchronous API Loading](https://github.com/TimothyGillespie/AngularLibraries)
I am currently working on a YouTube Player component for Angular, which utilizes the asynchronously loaded iFrame API.
As asynchronous APIs are not unique to YouTube, I am looking for a good way to fetch these APIs inside the Angular framework.

### [Graph Library for JavaScript and TypeScript](https://github.com/TimothyGillespie/JavascriptGraph)
I have always loved graphs ever since I have learned about graph theory. Other graph libraries already exist, this one is supposed to distinct itself by providing more algorithms, parser and writer for existing graph languages and predefined famous graphs. Work in progress.

### [Flashy Image Detection](https://github.com/TimothyGillespie/flashy_images_detection)
Photosensitive epileptics are endangered by flashy images in videos and GIFs all over the Internet. Mozilla recognizes this as an accessibility issue and also provide a much larger idea of the issue (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Seizure_disorders).

Seeing an extreme example of a Reddit ad prompted me to look into this topic. I found software for recognizing these instances, which is [PEAT](https://trace.umd.edu/peat/) and [the Harding Test](https://www.hardingtest.com/).

While PEAT seems to be free, it is not open source, and its usage is limited to Windows and apparently mostly via a GUI. The Harding Test seems to provide an online HTTP API but is not free and also not open source.

This really does not seem sufficient to me. Protection mostly relies on providers with few options for users to protect themselves. Providing a software with a decent and varied API may be a good starting point. This could be used as a base in a browser extension, a Web API, Plugins for Video Players or in various ways by media providers.

Currently, a prototype exists which is not yet satisfying (false positives). I hope I can find enough time to look into this again soon.

### Article about Building Upon Angular Components
Angular components can be built upon in various way, some of which are not entirely obvious. An article is currently planned to showcase these options
